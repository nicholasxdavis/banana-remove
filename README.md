## About

**Gemini Watermark Remover** (also known as Banana Remove) is a lightweight web application designed to automatically detect and remove the specific watermarks found on images generated by Google's Gemini models.

Unlike other tools that rely on heavy server-side processing or diffusion models, this project runs **100% in the browser**. It utilizes a ported `WatermarkEngine` that performs reverse alpha blending using pre-calculated alpha maps to mathematically subtract the watermark without destroying the underlying pixel data.


## How It Works

The core logic resides in `js/watermark-remover.js`. The removal process follows these steps:

1.  **Alpha Map Generation:** The engine loads reference background patterns to calculate the precise alpha channel values of the watermark.
2.  **Reverse Blending:** It iterates through the pixels in the watermark's bounding box.
3.  **Restoration:** Using the formula `original = (watermarked - alpha * LOGO_VALUE) / (1 - alpha)`, it restores the original pixel color values that were obscured by the semi-transparent watermark.
